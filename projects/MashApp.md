MashApp â€” creating, listening & sharing mashups

We named our app MashApp, paying homage to mashups, which often meet resistance from traditional music streaming services
As everyone already knows, Audius, a brand-new streaming platform built for musicians, was built quite successfully on IPFS. We're not trying to make a competitor for it, instead we're using its API to take it a step further. It would lower the barrier to content creation, by providing basic functionality for editing mashups right in the app, and publishing without risk of censorship, thanks to the IPFS

We want to make an updated version of our app, with a user-friendly UX, so that people can use our app as to go

The first step is to make a redesign, after that we can do the frontend and build the infrastructure in parallel. In the first near-term version we want to make the basic features and get feedback on it: mashup creation, editor and sharing functionality. To do this we need to connect a trained AI model in python, it will divide the song into vocals and instrumental, then user can overlay on these tracks and edit as he wants: trim, apply effects. After that we upload finished mashup to IPFS and let user share their mashup or download it

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p

<!-- Describe how your project uses any or all of these technologies, and why. -->

The dapp utilizes IPFS for decentralized audio/music file storage.

## Project Status

<!--brainstorming, fundraising, under development, beta, shipped, etc-->

The project was originally launched as a submission for Web3Jam Hackathon where it won Best Decentralized Media Hack 1st Place. As of now, the project is in its prototype stage and requires more work. We're working on a better UX as well as rethinking how we can build a better app

Our next steps would be primarily to redesign the app, deploy a backend infrastructure that will communicate with a service written in python. After that we want to develop playlist functionality

## Target Audience
